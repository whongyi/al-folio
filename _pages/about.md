I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in Information Science from Cornell University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Deborah Estrin](https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/). I hold a B.Eng in Computer Science from Tsinghua University. 

My research interest lies in developing human-in-the-loop machine learning systems and improving long-term values of personalizations. I lead the [<b>M</b>ultimodal <b>A</b>ccessible <b>P</b>ersonalization <b>S</b>ystems (MAPS)](/MAPS-research) research group at NYU Shanghai. Our recent work focuses on Recommender Systems, Generative Models and their applications in Learning and Creativity. 

üì¢ I'm looking for PhDs and undergrads to join our research group. Check our [PhD program](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/computer-science-phd-program) and contact me at <u>hongyi.wen@nyu.edu</u> if you are interested in the following topics:
- Fairness, Robustness and Privacy in Recommender Systems (focus on ML and Optimization)
- Personalizing Generative Language/Vision/Music Models (focus on ML and System Development)
- Personalization in Education and Health (focus on System Development and HCI)
