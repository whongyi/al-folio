I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in Information Science from Cornell University in 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Deborah Estrin](https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/). I hold a B.Eng. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University and during undergrad I worked with the [Pervasive HCI Group](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/research/). 

My research interest lies in developing human-in-the-loop machine learning systems to improve the long-term values for humans and the society. My current work focuses on Recommender Systems and Human-centered AI. I aim to develop better algorithms and user interactions to address social-technical challenges such as fairness, privacy and bias in these information systems.
